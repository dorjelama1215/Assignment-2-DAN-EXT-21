 Temperature Analysis Program (Question 2)


This program analyses temperature data collected from multiple Australian weather stations.
The data is stored in multiple CSV files inside the `temperatures` folder, with each file
representing one year of data.

The program processes ALL CSV files automatically and ignores missing temperature values (NaN).
