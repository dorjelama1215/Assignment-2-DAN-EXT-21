Question number 3 
Here we have created a recursive function to draw a geometric pattern using python turtle graphics
The edge is divided iinnto three equal segments and then replace the middle segment with two sides of an equilateral triangle pointing 
inward (creating an indentation) which  transforms one straight edge into four smaller edges, each 1/3 the length of 
the original edge and we apply this same process recursively to each of the four new edges based on the 
specified depth
